## What is DODO

DODO is a new generation of on-chain liquidity solutions, which uses the proactive market maker algorithm (PMM) to provide pure on-chain and contract-fillable liquidity.

## How does DODO work

DODO accepts liquidity providers (LP) assets. It gathers funds near the market price to provide sufficient liquidity. LP may face counterparty risk, so DODO will dynamically adjust the price to encourage arbitrageurs step in to limit the counterparty risk and keep the portfolio of the capital pool intact.

## Why DODO

- Less slippage
- Single risk exposure
- No impermanent loss

## What can I do with DODO

### As a trader

- Each and every trader enjoys sufficient liquidity very close to that of centralized exchanges
- Arbitrageurs can profit from the price difference between DODO and other exchanges
- Smart contracts can natively use DODO liquidity to complete on-chain transactions such as liquidations, auctions, etc

### As a LP

- There is no limitation on the deposit quantity and asset types
- DODO will charge a commission fee from each transaction and distribute the commission fee to LPs
- Create trading pairs of your own tokens. Liquidity can be obtained even with only your own tokens deposited.
